# Bugs and erros encountered during implementation



- Bug fixed : decryption key application -> index not in reverse order but in reverse words (4 bytes)

- Bug fixed : inverse shift row layer - wrong indexing

- Bug/logic error fixed: multiplication must perform reduction for each bit that is pushed out, not once for all shifts of single number.
